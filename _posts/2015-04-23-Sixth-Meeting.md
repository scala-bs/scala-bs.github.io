We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The sixth meeting will be held on **April 23rd, 2015**.

This meeting will repeat the topics from the last meeting:
In our first talk, Felix Geilert will discuss the actors framework Akka in his talk **We are Many**.
Afterwards, Philipp Wille begins a talk series about **Scala Basics** with the first talk **Expressions in Scala**.
