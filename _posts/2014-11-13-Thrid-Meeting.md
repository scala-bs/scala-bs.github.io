We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The third meeting will be held on **November 13th, 2014**

This meeting is our first **Dojo** (coding session).
Participants will learn basic Scala features hands-on with the help of more experienced Scala users.
The basic problems will i.a. be the [99 Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).
Further information can be found in our [Flyer](http://scala-bs.de/meetings/Scala-Enthusiasts-Braunschweig-Meeting-2014-11-13.pdf).
