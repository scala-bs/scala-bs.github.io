We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday every second month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The eighth meeting will be held on **June 11th, 2015**.

This meeting will cover the following topics:
In our first talk, Simon Barthel will discuss the ScalaTest Framework in his talk **ScalaTest – this.talk should be Good**.
Afterwards, Yevgen Pikus talks about **Apache Spark – Big Data in Scala**.
