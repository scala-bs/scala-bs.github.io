We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The fourth meeting will be held on **February 12th, 2015**.

This meeting will repeat the topics from the last meeting:
In our first talk, Simon Barthel will discuss the concept of type classes and its implementation in Scala.
In the second talk Felix Geilert will introduce the renown MVC web framework Play.
Please also refer to this meeting's [Flyer](http://scala-bs.de/meetings/Scala-Enthusiasts-Braunschweig-Meeting-2014-12-18.pdf).
