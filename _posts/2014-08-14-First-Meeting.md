We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The first meeting will be held on **August 14th, 2014**.

Contentwise, we will focus on a short introduction to Scala and provide an overview of its basics.
You will need no prior knowledge for this.
In our first talk you will learn about **Scala for Java Programmers** and how small adjustments turn a Java program into an executable Scala program.
The second talk about **Awesome Scala** deals with some selected features that make Scala extraordinary.
At the end, **Beyond Scala's Standard Library** provides a short overview over major Scala libraries and frameworks outside the Scala standard library.
Further information can be found in this [flyer](http://scala-bs.de/meetings/Scala-Enthusiasts-Braunschweig-Meeting-2014-08-14.pdf).

The most important dates for our first meeting are:

<dl>
    <dt>Date</dt><dd>Thursday, August 14th, 2014</dd>
    <dt>Location</dt><dd>Mühlenpfordtstraße 23, Room IZ 161</dd>
    <dt>Begin</dt><dd>6 PM</dd>
</dl>

We are looking forward to seeing you.
Special thanks go to the [Fachgruppenrat Informatik](http://fginfo.cs.tu-bs.de) of TU Braunschweig for the location.

### Conclusions

The meeting is over and it is time to post our materials and afterthoughts.
I have to say we were startled by the huge number of participants.
It is encouraging to see so many other programmers (40!) interested in Scala.
We really hope to see most of you again next month for our second meeting!
