We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on **every second Thursday each month**.
The first meeting will be held on **August 14th, 2014**.

Contentwise, we will focus on a short introduction to Scala and provide an overview of its basics.
You will need no prior knowledge for this.
In our first talk you will learn about **Scala for Java Programmers** and how small adjustments turn a Java program into an executable Scala program.
The second talk about **Awesome Scala** deals with some selected features that make Scala extraordinary.
At the end, **Beyond Scala's Standard Library** provides a short overview over major Scala libraries and frameworks outside the Scala standard library.
Further information can be found in this [flyer](http://scala-bs.de/meetings/Scala-Enthusiasts-Braunschweig-Meeting-2014-08-14.pdf).
