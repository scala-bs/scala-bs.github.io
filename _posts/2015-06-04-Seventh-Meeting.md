We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
This is a special meeting – we are invited to give a talk in the Programming Semantics class of Dr. Struckmann.
In our talk, Arne Brüsch and Philipp Wille will talk about the **Syntax of Pattern Matching** in Scala.
