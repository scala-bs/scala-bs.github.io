We are the **Scala Enthusiasts Braunschweig** – we are enthusiastic users of the programming language Scala.
Our goals are communicating our excitement to interested programmers and exchanging views on programming.
This is why we organize a meeting on approximately **every second Thursday each month**.
At most meetings presentations are held but we will also have pair programming sessions and discussions.
The second meeting will be held on **October 9th, 2014**.

Contentwise, we will focus on basic Scala features with no prior knowledge needed.
In our first talk **Functional Programming Basics in Scala** you will learn why functions are first-class citizens in Scala.
The second talk about **Implicit Functions and Parameters in Scala** tells you about the highly flexible implicits that make Scala feel like a dynamically typed language.
